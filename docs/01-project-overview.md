# 01 - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

**The Cabin** is a voice-controlled interactive fiction game for Android, built using .NET MAUI. Players explore mysterious environments by speaking commands, experiencing an immersive narrative-driven adventure that combines classic text adventure gameplay with modern speech recognition and AI-powered natural language processing.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Voice-First Experience**: Create a hands-free gaming experience using speech recognition and text-to-speech
2. **Cross-Platform Foundation**: Leverage .NET MAUI for potential future iOS support while initially targeting Android
3. **AI-Enhanced Gameplay**: Integrate LLM-based command parsing for natural language understanding
4. **Rich Narrative Content**: Support multiple thematic story packs with extensible content system
5. **Offline Capability**: Ensure core gameplay functions without internet connectivity

### Success Criteria

- Speech recognition accuracy > 90% for common commands
- Command processing latency < 2 seconds
- Smooth 60 FPS UI performance
- Support for 5+ thematic story packs
- Battery consumption < 15% per hour of gameplay

## Scope

### In Scope

- Android application (API Level 23+, Android 6.0+)
- Voice input and output
- 5 pre-built thematic story packs
- Local game state persistence
- Offline speech recognition option
- Online LLM integration for command parsing
- Text-based gameplay with voice narration
- Inventory and puzzle systems
- Save/load functionality

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- iOS implementation
- Multiplayer functionality
- AR/VR features
- Smart speaker integration
- Real-time voice synthesis during gameplay
- User-generated content tools
- Cloud save synchronization

### Future Considerations

- iOS version via MAUI
- Procedurally generated content
- Community content marketplace
- Accessibility features (visual impairment support)
- Localization and multi-language support

## Technology Stack Justification

### .NET MAUI

**Chosen for:**

- Native Android performance
- C# language benefits (strong typing, async/await, LINQ)
- Extensive library ecosystem
- Future cross-platform expansion (iOS, Windows)
- Mature MVVM framework support
- Microsoft backing and long-term support

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Native Kotlin: Limited to Android only
- Flutter: Dart language less familiar to .NET developers
- React Native: Performance concerns for real-time audio
- Xamarin.Forms: Deprecated in favor of MAUI

### Android Target Platform

**Minimum SDK**: API Level 23 (Android 6.0 Marshmallow)

- 95%+ device coverage
- Runtime permissions model support
- Modern speech recognition APIs

**Target SDK**: API Level 34 (Android 14)

- Latest security and performance features
- Predictive back gesture support
- Enhanced privacy controls

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Speech Recognition Accuracy

**Challenge**: Ambient noise, accents, and command variations
**Mitigation**:

- Confidence threshold filtering
- Context-aware re-prompting
- Multiple recognition engine support
- User calibration option

### 2. LLM Integration Latency

**Challenge**: Network delays affecting gameplay flow
**Mitigation**:

- Command caching for common actions
- Local fallback parser for basic commands
- Async processing with loading indicators
- Optimistic UI updates

### 3. Battery Consumption

**Challenge**: Continuous microphone and CPU usage
**Mitigation**:

- Push-to-talk option alongside voice activation
- Efficient audio processing
- TTS caching
- Background processing optimization

### 4. Offline Functionality

**Challenge**: LLM dependency for command parsing
**Mitigation**:

- Local rule-based parser for standard commands
- Offline-capable ML model integration (optional)
- Graceful degradation of features
- Clear online/offline mode indicators

- Release preparation

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 20-29 weeks (5-7 months)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- App startup time < 3 seconds
- Memory usage < 150 MB
- APK size < 50 MB
- Crash rate < 1%

### User Experience Metrics

- Voice command success rate > 85%
- Average session length > 15 minutes
- Game completion rate > 40%
- User rating target: 4.0+ stars

### Performance Metrics

- 60 FPS UI rendering
- Audio latency < 200ms
- Command processing < 2 seconds
- Battery drain < 15% per hour

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Speech recognition accuracy insufficient | Medium | High | Multiple engine support, fallback text input |
| LLM costs too high | Medium | Medium | Local parser fallback, command caching |
| Battery drain excessive | Low | High | Push-to-talk mode, optimization |
| Content creation bottleneck | Medium | Medium | AI-assisted content generation tools |
| Android fragmentation issues | Medium | Medium | Extensive device testing, graceful degradation |

## Team Structure Requirements
