# Phase 11: Additional Command Handlers - Summary

## Overview
Phase 11 implemented five additional command handlers to expand gameplay interactions, making The Cabin more feature-complete with a comprehensive set of actions players can perform in the game world.

## Components Created

### 1. Command Handlers (5 new files)

#### DropCommandHandler.cs (`src/TheCabin.Core/Engine/CommandHandlers/`)
- **Purpose**: Allows players to drop items from inventory back into the current room
- **Verb**: "drop" (synonyms: "leave", "discard", "put", "place")
- **Validation**: Checks if item is in inventory
- **Execution**: 
  - Removes item from inventory using IInventoryManager
  - Adds item back to current room's visible objects
  - Updates room's object list
  - Returns success message from object's drop action or default message

#### UseCommandHandler.cs (`src/TheCabin.Core/Engine/CommandHandlers/`)
- **Purpose**: Enables players to use items from inventory
- **Verb**: "use" (synonyms: "activate", "employ", "utilize", "apply")
- **Validation**: 
  - Checks if item is in inventory
  - Verifies item has a "use" action defined
- **Execution**:
  - Checks required flags before allowing use
  - Applies state changes to objects/rooms as defined in action
  - Checks for puzzle completion after use
  - Optionally consumes item if action specifies
  - Tracks usage count for reusable items
- **Integration**: Works with IPuzzleEngine to detect puzzle solutions

#### ExamineCommandHandler.cs (`src/TheCabin.Core/Engine/CommandHandlers/`)
- **Purpose**: Provides detailed descriptions of objects
- **Verb**: "examine" (synonyms: "inspect", "check", "study", "investigate", "x")
- **Validation**: Checks if object exists in room or inventory
- **Execution**:
  - Returns examine action message if defined, or object description
  - Adds contextual state information (current state, open/closed, lit/unlit)
  - Provides additional details for containers (open/closed status)
  - Provides additional details for lights (lit/unlit status)
- **Enhancement**: Richer object interaction than simple "look"

#### OpenCommandHandler.cs (`src/TheCabin.Core/Engine/CommandHandlers/`)
- **Purpose**: Opens doors, containers, and other openable objects
- **Verb**: "open" (synonyms: "unlock", "unseal")
- **Validation**:
  - Checks if object is Door or Container type
  - Verifies object has an "open" action
- **Execution**:
  - Checks if already open (prevents redundant actions)
  - Checks if locked (prevents opening locked objects)
  - Sets "is_open" flag to true in object state
  - Applies any defined state changes
  - Reveals contained objects if opening a container
- **Features**: Supports revealing hidden items inside containers

#### CloseCommandHandler.cs (`src/TheCabin.Core/Engine/CommandHandlers/`)
- **Purpose**: Closes doors, containers, and other closable objects
- **Verb**: "close" (synonyms: "shut", "lock", "seal")
- **Validation**:
  - Checks if object is Door or Container type
  - Verifies object has a "close" action
- **Execution**:
  - Checks if already closed (prevents redundant actions)
  - Sets "is_open" flag to false in object state
  - Applies any defined state changes
- **Complement**: Pairs with OpenCommandHandler for complete open/close mechanics

## Configuration Updates

### MauiProgram.cs Updates
Registered all five new command handlers in the dependency injection container:

```csharp
private static void RegisterEngineComponents(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Command handlers
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, MoveCommandHandler>();
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, TakeCommandHandler>();
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, DropCommandHandler>();        // NEW
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, UseCommandHandler>();         // NEW
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, ExamineCommandHandler>();     // NEW
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, OpenCommandHandler>();        // NEW
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, CloseCommandHandler>();       // NEW
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, LookCommandHandler>();
    services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler, InventoryCommandHandler>();
}
```

### LocalCommandParser Verification
Confirmed that LocalCommandParser already includes all new verbs and their synonyms in the VerbSynonyms dictionary:
- `drop`: "leave", "discard", "put", "place"
- `use`: "activate", "employ", "utilize", "apply"
- `open`: "unlock", "unseal"
- `close`: "shut", "lock", "seal"
- `examine`: "inspect", "check", "study", "investigate", "x"

## Command Handler Features

### Common Pattern
All handlers follow the established pattern:
1. **Constructor**: Inject required dependencies (GameStateMachine, IInventoryManager, etc.)
2. **ValidateAsync**: Check preconditions and return validation result
3. **ExecuteAsync**: Perform the action and return command result
4. **Helper Methods**: Private methods for state changes and special logic

### Dependency Usage
- **GameStateMachine**: All handlers use this to access current room and find objects
- **IInventoryManager**: Used by Drop, Use, and Examine handlers for inventory operations
- **IPuzzleEngine**: Used by Use handler to check for puzzle completions

### State Management
Handlers properly manage object and room state:
- Update object state flags (is_open, is_locked, etc.)
- Apply state changes defined in object actions
- Use reflection to set properties dynamically
- Handle special cases for different object types

## New Gameplay Capabilities

### With These Handlers, Players Can Now:
1. **Drop items** - Free up inventory space by dropping items in rooms
2. **Use items** - Activate items to solve puzzles, light objects, etc.
3. **Examine objects** - Get detailed information about any object
4. **Open containers/doors** - Access new areas and reveal hidden items
5. **Close containers/doors** - Maintain game state and create puzzles

### Enhanced Gameplay Examples:

**Example 1: Using a Lantern**
```
> take lantern
You pick up the lantern. It feels heavy with oil.

> examine lantern
An old brass lantern covered in rust and cobwebs. It appears to be unlit.

> use lantern
The lantern flickers to life, casting dancing shadows on the walls.
```

**Example 2: Container Puzzle**
```
> examine chest
A weathered wooden chest with iron bands. It is closed.

> open chest
The chest creaks open, revealing its contents.
You notice a rusty key!

> take key
You pick up the rusty key.

> close chest
You close the chest.
```

**Example 3: Inventory Management**
```
> inventory
You are carrying:
- Lantern
- Key
- Map
Total weight: 8/20

> drop map
You drop the map on the ground.

> inventory
You are carrying:
- Lantern
- Key
Total weight: 5/20
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Change System
The UseCommandHandler, OpenCommandHandler, and CloseCommandHandler all implement sophisticated state change systems:

```csharp
private void ApplyStateChange(StateChange change, GameObject targetObject, GameState gameState)
{
    switch (change.Target)
    {
        case "self":
            // Apply to the object itself
            break;
        case "room":
            // Apply to the current room
            break;
        default:
            // Apply to another object by ID
            break;
    }
}
```

### Puzzle Integration
UseCommandHandler integrates with PuzzleEngine:
```csharp
// Check for puzzle completion
var puzzleResult = await _puzzleEngine.CheckPuzzleCompletionAsync(gameState);
if (puzzleResult.Completed)
{
    messages.Add(puzzleResult.CompletionMessage);
    gameState.Player.Stats.PuzzlesSolved++;
}
```

### Container Reveal Logic
OpenCommandHandler reveals hidden items in containers:
```csharp
private void RevealContainedObjects(GameObject container, GameState gameState)
{
    if (container.RequiredItems != null && container.RequiredItems.Any())
    {
        foreach (var itemId in container.RequiredItems)
        {
            if (gameState.World.Objects.TryGetValue(itemId, out var item))
            {
                item.IsVisible = true;
                currentRoom.State.VisibleObjectIds.Add(itemId);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Command Routing

All handlers are automatically discovered and registered by the CommandRouter through dependency injection. The router matches verbs to handlers and executes them in sequence:

1. User speaks: "use lantern"
2. Voice recognition converts to text
3. Parser creates ParsedCommand with verb="use", object="lantern"
4. CommandRouter finds UseCommandHandler (verb matches)
5. Handler validates command
6. Handler executes action
7. Result displayed to user

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Test Coverage Needed:
- [x] DropCommandHandler validation logic
- [x] UseCommandHandler with puzzle completion
- [x] ExamineCommandHandler with different object types
- [x] OpenCommandHandler with locked objects
- [x] CloseCommandHandler with already-closed objects
- [ ] Integration tests with full game flow
- [ ] Edge cases (null objects, missing actions, etc.)

### Manual Testing Scenarios:
- Drop item and pick it back up
- Use consumable items
- Examine lit vs unlit objects
- Open locked vs unlocked containers
- Close already-closed doors
- Use items that trigger puzzles
