Phase 10 implemented complete save/load game functionality, allowing players to save their progress and load previously saved games. This includes a dedicated Load Game page with a beautiful UI showing all saved games with their details.

## Components Created

  - UI-specific properties: Icon (theme-based emoji), formatted dates/times, health color
  - Smart formatting for location names and display values

### 2. ViewModels

  - Manages the load game screen
  - Loads list of saved games from GameStateService
  - Commands: LoadGameAsync, DeleteGameAsync, CancelAsync
  - Handles confirmation dialogs for loading and deleting saves
  - Returns to MainPage with LoadSaveId parameter when game selected

### 3. Views
- **LoadGamePage.xaml** (`src/TheCabin.Maui/Views/`)

## Technical Implementation

### Save/Load Architecture
```
Player Action (Save/Load Button)
    ‚Üì
MainViewModel Command
    ‚Üì
GameStateService
    ‚Üì
GameSaveRepository
    ‚Üì
SQLite Database (thecabin.db3)
```

### Parameter Passing
- LoadGamePage returns to MainPage using Shell navigation with parameters
- Parameters passed as `Dictionary<string, object>`
- MainPage implements `IQueryAttributable` to receive parameters
- LoadSaveId extracted and passed to ViewModel for loading

### Data Persistence
- Saves stored in SQLite database
- Each save contains full GameState JSON
- Metadata stored separately for fast listing
- Auto-saves could be added in future phases

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Save game creates new entry in database
- [x] Load game restores exact game state
- [x] Delete game removes from database
- [x] Multiple saves can coexist
- [x] Save names are customizable
- [x] Load confirmation prevents accidental loads
- [x] Delete confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- [x] Empty state displays correctly
- [x] Navigation between pages works smoothly
- [x] UI updates correctly after load
- [x] Story feed clears and repopulates on load
