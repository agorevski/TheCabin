# Phase 17D Progress: Enhanced Puzzle System Models

## Status: Data Models Complete ✅

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Enhanced Data Models ✅
All puzzle-related models have been updated with new properties to support the enhanced puzzle system:

**PuzzleState.cs**
- Changed `CompletedSteps` from `List<int>` to `List<string>` (for step IDs)
- Added `IsActive` property to track if puzzle is currently being worked on
- Added `LastActivityAt` property for time-based hints
- Updated `CompleteStep()` method to accept string IDs

**Puzzle.cs**
- Added `AchievementId` property for puzzle completion achievements
- Retained existing `CompletionAchievementId` for backward compatibility
- Already had `Hints` list and other necessary properties

**Hint.cs**
- Added `Order` property for display sequence
- Added `DelayMinutes` property for time-based hint availability
- Retained existing `Level`, `Text`, and `Cost` properties

**Other Models**
- PuzzleStep.cs - Already complete with all needed properties
- PuzzleStepResult.cs - Already complete
- Enums.cs - PuzzleType enum already defined

### Build Status ✅
- **Core library**: Compiled successfully
- **All tests**: 126 tests passed (0 failed)
- **Warnings**: 1 minor nullable warning in UseCommandHandler (pre-existing)

### Next Steps

1. **Update PuzzleEngine Implementation**
   - Modify methods to use string-based step IDs instead of integers
   - Implement time-based hint system using `DelayMinutes` and `LastActivityAt`
   - Update puzzle activation tracking with `IsActive` flag
   - Add support for achievement integration via `AchievementId`

2. **Create Sample Puzzles**
   - Design multi-step puzzle examples using new model structure
   - Create puzzle JSON files for classic_horror story pack
   - Test puzzle serialization/deserialization

3. **New Command Handlers**
   - Implement `HintCommandHandler` for requesting hints
   - Implement `SolveCommandHandler` for puzzle-specific solutions
   - Update existing handlers to trigger puzzle checks

4. **Update StoryPack Format**
   - Add puzzles section to story pack JSON schema
   - Update StoryPackService to load puzzles
   - Create validation for puzzle data

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for PuzzleEngine updates
   - Write tests for new command handlers
   - Integration tests for complete puzzle flows

6. **Update Story Packs**
   - Add puzzles to existing story pack JSON files
   - Test end-to-end puzzle gameplay

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/TheCabin.Core/Models/PuzzleState.cs`
- ✅ `src/TheCabin.Core/Models/Puzzle.cs`
- ✅ `src/TheCabin.Core/Models/Hint.cs`

### Files to Modify Next
- `src/TheCabin.Core/Engine/PuzzleEngine.cs`
- `src/TheCabin.Core/Models/StoryPack.cs` (add Puzzles list)
- `src/TheCabin.Core/Services/StoryPackService.cs`

## Timeline
- **Start**: Phase 17D initiated
- **Data Models Complete**: Now (50% complete)
- **Next Milestone**: PuzzleEngine implementation (target: next session)
- **Phase 17D Target**: Complete enhanced puzzle system

## Notes
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Backward compatibility maintained where possible
- Ready to proceed with PuzzleEngine implementation
