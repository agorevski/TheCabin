Overview\n\n**The Cabin (Voice Edition)** is a modern reimagining of the classic text adventure genre — an immersive voice-controlled interactive fiction game for Android.\n\nPlayers explore a mysterious cabin by *speaking commands* instead of typing them. Speech recognition, natural language parsing, and dynamic text-to-speech narration create a hands-free, story-driven experience.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Gameplay Loop\n\n1. **Listen:** The app activates the microphone and records the player’s command.\n2. **Transcribe:** Speech-to-text (STT) ML model converts voice → text.\n3. **Parse:** A GPT-based parser interprets player intent and generates structured JSON commands.\n4. **Simulate:** The game engine updates the world state based on those commands.\n5. **Respond:** Narration text (and optional TTS) describes the outcome.\n6. **Repeat:** The player continues exploring until the mystery resolves.\n\n---\n\n## 3. UX / UI Design\n\n### 3.1 Screen Layout\n- **Top Bar:** Location name and player stats (health, light, time).\n- **Main Text Panel:** Scrollable story feed with dynamic narrative text.\n- **Voice Control Section:**\n  - Central microphone button with waveform animation.\n  - Transcript preview (“You said: look under the bed”).\n- **Inventory Drawer:** Slide-up panel showing objects and tools.\n- **Settings Menu:** TTS toggle, difficulty, theme selection.\n\n### 3.2 Voice Experience\n- Tap or say “Listen” to activate the mic.\n- Speech recognition uses an on-device model (Whisper.cpp or Android SpeechRecognizer).\n- Short-term context memory keeps the last 10 player actions for narrative continuity.\n\n---\n\n## 4. System Architecture\n\n### 4.1 Data Flow\n```\nPlayer Voice\n   ↓\nSpeech-to-Text (STT)\n   ↓\nParser (LLM / GPT)\n   ↓\nGame Engine (State Machine)\n   ↓\nResponse Text\n   ↓\nText-to-Speech (TTS) → Audio Output\n```\n\n### 4.2 Components\n\n| Layer | Technology | Description |\n|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Frontend** | Kotlin + Jetpack Compose | UI, voice controls, and game loop management. |\n| **STT Layer** | Whisper.cpp / Android SpeechRecognizer | Converts player voice into text. |\n| **Parser Layer** | GPT-based API or local intent model | Translates text commands into structured JSON actions. |\n| **Engine** | Kotlin state machine | Manages rooms, inventory, puzzles, and outcomes. |\n| **TTS Layer** | Android TextToSpeech / OpenAI TTS | Narrates game responses. |\n| **Storage** | RoomDB or JSON files | Saves world definitions, progress, and content packs. |\n| **Optional Backend** | Firebase / AWS | Theme content delivery, analytics, updates. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Data Models\n\n### 5.1 Room Model\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"cabin_main\",\n  \"description\": \"You stand in a dimly lit wooden cabin...\",\n  \"objects\": [\"lantern\", \"door\"],\n  \"exits\": {\"north\": \"forest_edge\"}\n}\n```\n\n### 5.2 Object Model\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"lantern\",\n  \"state\": \"unlit\",\n  \"actions\": {\n    \"take\": \"You pick up the lantern.\",\n    \"light\": \"It flickers to life.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5.3 Player State\n```json\n{\n  \"inventory\": [\"note\"],\n  \"health\": 100,\n  \"location\": \"cabin_main\",\n  \"light_level\": \"low\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Implementation Details\n\n### 6.1 Speech Recognition\n- Default: Android’s built-in **SpeechRecognizer** API.\n- Offline mode: Integrate **Whisper.cpp** or **Vosk** for on-device inference.\n- Output confidence threshold: 0.75 (re-prompt player if lower).\n\n### 6.2 Command Parsing\n- Use GPT-4o-mini or local distilled LLM to translate text into structured JSON commands.\n- Example Input: “Pick up the lantern on the table.”  \n- Example Output:\n  ```json\n  {\"verb\": \"take\", \"object\": \"lantern\", \"context\": \"table\"}\n  ```\n\n### 6.3 Game Engine\n- Built in Kotlin as a finite state machine.\n- Each command triggers transitions between rooms, updates object states, and appends to the story log.\n- Use coroutine scopes for async I/O (voice recording, GPT calls, TTS playback).\n\n### 6.4 TTS Narration\n- Uses Android TextToSpeech by default.\n- Supports dynamic voice selection and speech speed adjustment.\n- Optional: integrate OpenAI or ElevenLabs API for realistic narration.\n\n### 6.5 Content Management\n- Each theme pack (JSON) is stored in `/assets/themes/`.\n- New packs can be downloaded or generated dynamically from GPT.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Thematic Packs\n\nPrebuilt content packs (5 included):\n- **Classic Horror:** Haunted log cabin, decaying interiors, candlelight.\n- **Arctic Survival:** Polar outpost, dwindling power, freezing tension.\n- **Fantasy Magic:** Wizard’s workshop, glowing runes, spellcraft puzzles.\n- **Sci-Fi Isolation:** Derelict space module, system malfunctions, alien dread.\n- **Cozy Mystery:** Snowbound lodge, warm atmosphere, hidden secrets.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Meta-Prompts (for Generating New Content)\n\n### Theme Generator\n```\nGenerate 10 new themes for 'The Cabin' game.\nEach should include: setting, mood, gameplay style, and short pitch.\n```\n\n### Content Pack Creator\n```\nUsing theme [THEME], generate a JSON content bundle:\n- theme, description, 6-10 rooms, interconnected exits\n- each room has id, description, objects, exits\nEnsure thematic consistency.\n```\n\n### Object Expansion\n```\nGenerate JSON behaviors for objects in theme [THEME]:\n- actions (take, use, open, combine)\n- state transitions\n```\n\n### Dynamic Events\n```\nFor theme [THEME], produce 5 random narrative events:\n- trigger_condition\n- event_text\n- consequences\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Technical Challenges & Solutions\n\n| Challenge | Solution |\n|------------|-----------|\n| Latency | Cache TTS + use streaming Whisper for low delay. |\n| STT accuracy | Confidence fallback → re-prompt user. |\n| LLM cost | Cache parsed commands; use smaller local models for frequent actions. |\n| Offline support | Store all JSON content locally and use embedded STT/TTS. |\n\n---\n\n## 10. Future Expansions\n- Multiplayer voice sessions (“two explorers trapped together”).\n- Daily procedural cabin stories.\n- AR overlay (physical-world cabin mapping).\n- Integration with smart speakers for ambient play.\n\n---\n\n</file_content>"},{"type":"text","text":"\n\n# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)\n\n\n\nWhile in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.\n\nReminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:\n\n\n\n1.

return builder.Build();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### Game State Hierarchy\n\n```\nGameState (Root)\n├── PlayerState\n│   ├── CurrentLocation\n│   ├── Health\n│   ├── Inventory[]\n│   └── StatusEffects[]\n├── WorldState\n│   ├── CurrentTheme\n│   ├── Rooms[]\n│   │   ├── RoomState\n│   │   └── Objects[]\n│   └── GlobalVariables{}\n├── ProgressState\n│   ├── CompletedPuzzles[]\n│   ├── UnlockedAreas[]\n│   └── StoryFlags{}\n└── MetaState\n    ├── PlayTime\n    ├── SaveTimestamp\n    └── Version\n```\n\n### State Persistence Strategy\n\n1. **In-Memory State**: Active game state held in `GameStateService`\n2. **Auto-Save**: State persisted every significant action\n3. **Manual Save**: Player-triggered save to named slots\n4. **Checkpoint System**: Automatic checkpoints at major story points\n\n## Communication Patterns\n\n### Event Aggregator Pattern\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IEventAggregator\n{\n    void Subscribe<T>(Action<T> handler);\n    void Publish<T>(T eventData);\n}\n\n// Events\npublic class GameStateChangedEvent { }\npublic class InventoryUpdatedEvent { }\npublic class LocationChangedEvent { }\npublic class CommandProcessedEvent { }\n```\n\n### Message Flow\n\n```\nView → ViewModel → Service → Domain → Repository\n  ↑                                        ↓\n  └──────── Events/Notifications ──────────┘\n```\n\n## Error Handling Strategy\n\n### Layered Error Handling\n\n1. **UI Layer**: User-friendly error messages\n2. **Service Layer**: Retry logic and fallbacks\n3. **Domain Layer**: Business rule validation\n4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Exception logging\n\n### Specific Strategies\n\n```csharp\n// Voice Recognition Errors\ntry\n{\n    var result = await _voiceService.RecognizeSpeechAsync();\n}\ncatch (PermissionException ex)\n{\n    // Prompt user for microphone permission\n}\ncatch (SpeechRecognitionException ex)\n{\n    // Show \"Didn't catch that, please try again\"\n}\n\n// LLM API Errors\ntry\n{\n    var parsed = await _llmService.ParseCommandAsync(text);\n}\ncatch (ApiException ex)\n{\n    // Fall back to local parser\n    var parsed = await _localParser.ParseCommandAsync(text);\n}\ncatch (NetworkException ex)\n{\n    // Queue command for retry or offer offline mode\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Lazy Loading**: Load story packs on demand\n2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse audio buffers and UI elements\n3. **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations for all I/O\n4. **Caching**: Command cache, TTS audio cache, image cache\n5. **Virtual Scrolling**: For long story text feeds\n6. **Background Processing**: Parse commands off UI thread\n\n### Memory Management\n\n- Dispose audio resources properly\n- Clear old story text beyond certain threshold\n- Unload unused theme assets\n- Monitor memory pressure events\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### Data Protection\n\n1. **API Keys**: Stored in secure storage, never in code\n2. **Permissions**: Runtime permission requests\n3. **Network Security**: HTTPS only for API calls\n4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt save files (optional)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- Voice data processed locally or transmitted securely\n- No persistent audio recording storage\n- Clear privacy policy for any telemetry\n\n## Testing Architecture\n\n###

return builder.Build();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## State Management\n\n### Game State Hierarchy\n\n```\nGameState (Root)\n├── PlayerState\n│   ├── CurrentLocation\n│   ├── Health\n│   ├── Inventory[]\n│   └── StatusEffects[]\n├── WorldState\n│   ├── CurrentTheme\n│   ├── Rooms[]\n│   │   ├── RoomState\n│   │   └── Objects[]\n│   └── GlobalVariables{}\n├── ProgressState\n│   ├── CompletedPuzzles[]\n│   ├── UnlockedAreas[]\n│   └── StoryFlags{}\n└── MetaState\n    ├── PlayTime\n    ├── SaveTimestamp\n    └── Version\n```\n\n### State Persistence Strategy\n\n1. **In-Memory State**: Active game state held in `GameStateService`\n2. **Auto-Save**: State persisted every significant action\n3. **Manual Save**: Player-triggered save to named slots\n4. **Checkpoint System**: Automatic checkpoints at major story points\n\n## Communication Patterns\n\n### Event Aggregator Pattern\n\n```csharp\npublic interface IEventAggregator\n{\n    void Subscribe<T>(Action<T> handler);\n    void Publish<T>(T eventData);\n}\n\n// Events\npublic class GameStateChangedEvent { }\npublic class InventoryUpdatedEvent { }\npublic class LocationChangedEvent { }\npublic class CommandProcessedEvent { }\n```\n\n### Message Flow\n\n```\nView → ViewModel → Service → Domain → Repository\n  ↑                                        ↓\n  └──────── Events/Notifications ──────────┘\n```\n\n## Error Handling Strategy\n\n### Layered Error Handling\n\n1. **UI Layer**: User-friendly error messages\n2. **Service Layer**: Retry logic and fallbacks\n3. **Domain Layer**: Business rule validation\n4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Exception logging\n\n### Specific Strategies\n\n```csharp\n// Voice Recognition Errors\ntry\n{\n    var result = await _voiceService.RecognizeSpeechAsync();\n}\ncatch (PermissionException ex)\n{\n    // Prompt user for microphone permission\n}\ncatch (SpeechRecognitionException ex)\n{\n    // Show \"Didn't catch that, please try again\"\n}\n\n// LLM API Errors\ntry\n{\n    var parsed = await _llmService.ParseCommandAsync(text);\n}\ncatch (ApiException ex)\n{\n    // Fall back to local parser\n    var parsed = await _localParser.ParseCommandAsync(text);\n}\ncatch (NetworkException ex)\n{\n    // Queue command for retry or offer offline mode\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Lazy Loading**: Load story packs on demand\n2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse audio buffers and UI elements\n3. **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations for all I/O\n4. **Caching**: Command cache, TTS audio cache, image cache\n5. **Virtual Scrolling**: For long story text feeds\n6. **Background Processing**: Parse commands off UI thread\n\n### Memory Management\n\n- Dispose audio resources properly\n- Clear old story text beyond certain threshold\n- Unload unused theme assets\n- Monitor memory pressure events\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### Data Protection\n\n1. **API Keys**: Stored in secure storage, never in code\n2. **Permissions**: Runtime permission requests\n3. **Network Security**: HTTPS only for API calls\n4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt save files (optional)\n\n### Privacy\n\n- Voice data processed locally or transmitted securely\n- No persistent audio recording storage\n- Clear privacy policy for any telemetry\n\n## Testing Architecture\n\n### Test Pyramid\n\n```\n        ┌───────────┐\n        │    E2E    │  (10%)\n        ├───────────┤\n        │Integration│  (20%)\n        ├───────────┤\n        │   Unit    │  (70%)\n        └───────────┘\n```\n\n### Test Strategy\n\n1. **Unit Tests**: Services, ViewModels, Domain Logic\n2. **Integration Tests**: Service interactions, Data access\n3. **UI Tests**: Critical user flows\n4. **Manual Tests**: Voice recognition accuracy, Device compatibility\n\n---\n\n**Document Version**: 1.0  \n**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23  \n**Related Documents**: 03-technical-stack.md,

Timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL\n);\n\n-- Command cache\nCREATE TABLE CommandCache (\n    CommandHash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    ContextHash TEXT NOT NULL,\n    ParsedJson TEXT NOT NULL,\n    Confidence REAL,\n    Timestamp INTEGER\n);\n\n-- Settings\nCREATE TABLE Settings (\n    Key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Value TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\n### Alternative: LiteDB\n\n```xml\n<PackageReference Include=\"LiteDB\" Version=\"5.0.17\" />\n```\n\n**Pros**:\n- NoSQL document database\n- No SQL required\n- Simple API\n- Good for JSON storage\n\n## Android Permissions\n\n### Required Permissions\n\n```xml\n<!-- AndroidManifest.xml -->\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WAKE_LOCK\" />\n\n<!-- Optional -->\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.VIBRATE\" />\n```\n\n### Runtime Permission Handling\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task<bool> RequestMicrophonePermissionAsync()\n{\n    var status = await Permissions.CheckStatusAsync<Permissions.Microphone>();\n    \n    if (status != PermissionStatus.Granted)\n    {\n        status = await Permissions.RequestAsync<Permissions.Microphone>();\n    }\n    \n    return status == PermissionStatus.Granted;\n}\n```\n\n## Build and Deployment\n\n### Android Build Configurations\n\n**Debug**:\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'\">\n    <AndroidEnableProfiledAot>false</AndroidEnableProfiledAot>\n    <AndroidLinkMode>None</AndroidLinkMode>\n    <DebugSymbols>true</DebugSymbols>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n**Release**:\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'\">\n    <AndroidEnableProfiledAot>true</AndroidEnableProfiledAot>\n    <AndroidLinkMode>SdkOnly</AndroidLinkMode>\n    <AndroidUseAapt2>true</AndroidUseAapt2>\n    <AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi>false</AndroidCreatePackagePerAbi>\n    <EnableLLVM>false</EnableLLVM>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n### APK Size Optimization\n\n1. **Enable ProGuard/R8 shrinking**\n2. **Use APK splits for different architectures**\n3. **Compress assets**\n4. **Remove unused resources**\n5. **Use vector drawables instead of PNGs**\n\n**Target Size**: < 50 MB (without Whisper model)\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n### Recommended Git Workflow\n\n```bash\nmain (production)\n  ├─ develop (integration)\n  │   ├─ feature/voice-pipeline\n  │   ├─ feature/game-engine\n  │   └─ feature/ui-components\n  └─ hotfix/* (urgent fixes)\n```\n\n### CI/CD Considerations\n\n- GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps\n- Automated testing on every PR\n- APK builds on merge to develop\n- Release builds tagged in main\n\n## Performance Profiling Tools\n\n- Android Studio Profiler\n- Visual Studio Performance Profiler\n- dotTrace (JetBrains)\n- MAUI Blazor DevTools\n\n---\n\n**Document

  \";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage Analytics\n\n```csharp\npublic class AnalyticsService\n{\n    public void TrackEvent(string eventName, \n        Dictionary<string, string> properties = null)\n    {\n        Analytics.TrackEvent(eventName, properties);\n    }\n    \n    public void TrackGameSession(GameSession session)\n    {\n        TrackEvent(\"game_session_completed\", new

     return new RollbackRecommendation\n            {\n                ShouldRollback = true,\n                Reason = $\"High crash rate: {crashRate:P}\"\n            };\n        }\n        \n        if (errorRate > 0.20) // 20% error rate\n        {\n            return new RollbackRecommendation\n            {\n                ShouldRollback = true,\n                Reason = $\"High error rate: {errorRate:P}\"\n            };\n        }\n        \n        return new RollbackRecommendation\n        {\n            ShouldRollback = false\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Rollback Process\n\n1. **Halt Production Rollout**: Pause staged rollout at current percentage\n2. **Investigate**: Review crash logs and user feedback\n3. **Fix or Revert**: Either hotfix and re-release, or revert to previous version\n4. **Communicate**: Notify users of issues and resolution timeline\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### API Key Management\n\n```csharp\n// Store sensitive keys in secure storage\npublic class SecureConfigService\n{\n    public async Task<string> GetApiKeyAsync(string keyName)\n    {\n        return await SecureStorage.GetAsync(keyName);\n    }\n    \n    public async Task SetApiKeyAsync(string keyName, string value)\n    {\n        await SecureStorage.SetAsync(keyName, value);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ProGuard/R8 Configuration\n\n```\n# Keep model classes\n-keep class TheCabin.Models.** { *; }\n\n# Keep API client interfaces\n-keep interface TheCabin.Services.I** { *; }\n\n# Keep custom exceptions\n-keep class TheCabin.Exceptions.** { *; }\n```\n\n## Release

**Halt Production Rollout**: Pause staged rollout at current percentage\n2. **Investigate**: Review crash logs and user feedback\n3. **Fix or Revert**: Either hotfix and re-release, or revert to previous version\n4. **Communicate**: Notify users of issues and resolution timeline\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### API Key Management\n\n```csharp\n// Store sensitive keys in secure storage\npublic class SecureConfigService\n{\n    public async Task<string> GetApiKeyAsync(string keyName)\n    {\n        return await SecureStorage.GetAsync(keyName);\n    }\n    \n    public async Task SetApiKeyAsync(string keyName, string value)\n    {\n        await SecureStorage.SetAsync(keyName, value);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ProGuard/R8 Configuration\n\n```\n# Keep model classes\n-keep class TheCabin.Models.** { *; }\n\n# Keep API client interfaces\n-keep interface TheCabin.Services.I** { *; }\n\n# Keep custom exceptions\n-keep class TheCabin.Exceptions.** { *; }\n```\n\n## Release
